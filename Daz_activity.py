Volibear = "#WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I SEE A BEAR? \nSeeing a bear in the wild is a special treat for any visitor to a national park. While it is an exciting moment, it is important to remember that bears in national parks are wild and can be dangerous. Their behavior is sometimes unpredictable. Although rare, attacks on humans have occurred, inflicting serious injuries and death. Each bear and each experience is unique; there is no single strategy that will work in all situations and that guarantees safety. Most bear encounters end without injury. Following some basic guidelines may help to lessen the threat of danger. Your safety can depend on your ability to calm the bear.\nWhen you arrive in a park, always remember to check with the nearest visitor center or backcountry office for the latest bear safety information. \n#AVOIDING AN ENCOUNTER \nFollowing viewing etiquette is the first step to avoiding an encounter with a bear that could escalate into an attack. Keeping your distance and not surprising bears are some of the most important things you can do. Most bears will avoid humans if they hear them coming. Pay attention to your surroundings and make a special effort to be noticeable if you are in an area with known bear activity or a good food source, such as berry bushes \n#BEAR ENCOUNTERS \nOnce a bear has noticed you and is paying attention to you, additional strategies can help prevent the situation from escalating. \nIDENTIFY YOURSELF by talking calmly so the bear knows you are a human and not a prey animal. Remain still; stand your ground but slowly wave your arms. Help the bear recognize you as a human. It may come closer or stand on its hind legs to get a better look or smell. A standing bear is usually curious, not threatening."

Daiwa = "Daiwa and his Daiwa lived alone in a small Daiwa on an Daiwa. Daiwa kept to himself, drawing Daiwas and playing with his Daiwas as his Daiwa watched Christian Daiwa on the Daiwa. Daiwa was Daiwa, and they were both Daiwa. That was, until Daiwa's Daiwa heard an Daiwa from Daiwa. 'Your Daiwa has become Daiwa by Daiwa, he needs to be Daiwa.' 'I will do my best Daiwa, my Daiwa', she replied, rushing into Daiwa's Daiwa, removing all that was Daiwa from his Daiwa. Again, the Daiwa called Daiwa. 'Daiwa's Daiwa is still Daiwa. He needs to be cut off from all that is Daiwa in his Daiwa and confess his Daiwas.' 'I will follow your Daiwa, I have Daiwa in thee', Daiwa's Daiwa replied, as she locked Daiwa in his Daiwa, away from the Daiwas of the Daiwa. One last Daiwa, Daiwa's Daiwa heard the Daiwa of Daiwa calling to Daiwa. 'You've done as I've asked, but I still question your Daiwa to Daiwa. To prove your Daiwa, I will ask one more Daiwa of Daiwa.' 'Yes, Daiwa, anything.' Daiwa's Daiwa begged. 'To prove your Daiwa in Daiwa, I require Daiwa. Your Daiwa will be the Daiwa. Go into his Daiwa, and end his Daiwa, as an Daiwa to Daiwa to prove you Daiwa me above all Daiwa.' 'Yes, Daiwa', she replied, grabbing an Daiwa from the Daiwa. Daiwa, watching through an Daiwa in his Daiwa, trembled in Daiwa. Scrambling around his Daiwa to find an Daiwa, he noticed an Daiwa to the Daiwa, hidden under his Daiwa. Without Daiwa, he flung open the Daiwa, just as Daiwa burst through his Daiwa, and threw himself down into the unknown Daiwas below."

You're ill. Okay. Nami mains come with the most bizarre confidence or something where, I don't even know where it comes from. They're often the dumbest of the enchanter support mains, while simultaneously being the most beta aggressive. Now I don't even know how they accomplished that, but it's true it is true tell me I'm wrong, you can't. And then it's almost like they're playing inebriated because of the speed they cast like their ultimate or their bubble or like everything else it's the weirdest thing. And most of their shit that they do is predicated on just pressing like their enhanced damage ability on the AD carries that usually are paired with them like caitlyn and draven. I don't even know!"

F1 = "Gentlemen, a short view back to the past. Thirty years ago, Niki Lauda told us: 'Take a trained monkey, place him into the cockpit and he is able to drive the car.' Thirty years later Sebastian told us: 'I had to start my car like a computer. It's very complicated.' And Nico Rosbeg said, err, he pressed during the race, I don't remember what race, the wrong button on the wheel. Question for you to both. Is formula 1 driving today too complicated with 20 and more buttons on the wheel, are you too much under effort, under pressure? What are your wishes for the future, concerning technical program, errrm, during the race? Less buttons, more? Or less and more comunication with your engineers."
