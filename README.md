# Discord_Bot: Daz's Hunting Horn
Python discord bot hosted on Replit + Uptimerobot, that can run commands based on !.
This project was actively worked on from late February - mid April 2022. It was started purely to get a better grasp of Python, API requests, working with JSON and working with classes. 

### Things the bot can do 
- Retrieve a random quote from zenquotes.io
- Open weather map API (weather forecast for any queried city for the next hour)
- RIOT API (if key updated - retrieve the top 10 players of the Asia Pacific valorant leaderboard: Rank, Name, no. wins in the act)
- Create QR code for any given url
- Query google and return the title, link and description of the first result
- A simulation of the infinite monkey theorem
- React to certain prompts with either text or emotes
- "Economy" points system
  * Open an account stored in a json file
  * Check the balance of the user's account
  * Donate funds to any user's account 
  * Request more funds to the user's account
  * Query how many points each user has loaned
  * A rudimentary betting system relying on the discord poll
  * Query how many points each user has earned from bets
  * A leaderboard of how many points each user has
- A draft Dungeons and Dragons system:
  * The ability to roll an X sided die Y times, with a Z modifier
  * Create a new randomly generated DnD character that is then stored in a json file
    * Rerunning the command replaces the DnD character for the user 
  * Retrieve information about any user's generated character
  * Change stats or features of a generated character to the user's preference or as the campaign progresses
  * Deal damage or heal a user via the character's class.hp
